## Key Implementation Details

### Navigation Pattern
All navigation uses `Navigator.push()` with `MaterialPageRoute` for consistent transitions.

### Data Management
- Profile data is managed through the existing `RegistrationService`
- Settings preferences are stored in local state (can be extended to persistent storage)
- Emergency contacts are stored in local state with add/edit/delete functionality

### UI Components
- Consistent use of purple color scheme (`Colors.purple.shade600`)
- Modern card-based layouts with shadows and rounded corners
- Switch tiles for boolean settings
- List tiles for navigation items
- Proper loading states and error handling

## Usage
1. **Profile Access**: Click the profile icon in the home screen or go to Settings > Profile Information
2. **Settings Navigation**: Access any setting item from the Settings screen to navigate to dedicated pages
3. **Data Management**: Use the profile screen to edit user information or delete the account
4. **Emergency Setup**: Configure emergency contacts and notification preferences for safety

The app now provides a complete navigation experience with dedicated screens for all major user information and settings management features.
